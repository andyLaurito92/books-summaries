# Concepts

- Reliability: System should continue to work *correctly* even in the face of *adversity*

*What is correctly?* It means that it needs to fulfill the functional and non-functional requirement it was built for. 
*What is adversity?* Hardware or software failure, human error.

- Scalability: Growh in terms of data it receives. Question: If our system growths, what are our options to cope w/that growth?

- Maintainability: Keep working productively in the system even after many people work on them

## Questions

- How do you ensure that the data remains correct and compelte? Even when things go wrong internally?
- How do you provide consistently good performance to clients, even when parts of
your system are degraded?
- How do you scale to handle an increase in load?
- What does a good API for the service look like?

## Factors that influence design of a system

- Skills and experience of the people
- Legacy system depenedencies
- Timescale for delivery
- Organization's tolerance of different kinds of risk, regulatory constraints, etc.
