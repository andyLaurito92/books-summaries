Seems like there's no a specific book for system design interviews. I'll list some of the ones I'll go over on:

1. Designing Data-intensive applications
2. System design interview: An Insider's guide
3. There's a [grokking the system design interview course](https://www.designgurus.io/course/grokking-the-system-design-interview) which is not free, but has a nice index to follow along
