K.N.King book. I'll be using it as a brush up on C so I can better grasp the content of advanced programming in unix

Kings webpage can be found [here](http://knking.com/). Resources of this book can be found at this [link](http://knking.com/books/c2/)

## Why learning C?

Without knowing that much, it seems like C is the Operating system language. Many O.S. are written in C:

- [XNU](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu): The kernel for the Darwin O.S. (macOS)
- [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux): In reality, linux is hosted here: https://git.kernel.org/, the github repo is just a mirror
- [FreeBSD](https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-src)

Without saying that many of the known programming languages nowadays, such as Java or Python, have in it's core C :)

- [cpython](https://github.com/python/cpython)
- [opnejdk](https://github.com/freebsd)

So my take away: Learn C to get deeper into stuff. Welcome to un-explore territory :D
