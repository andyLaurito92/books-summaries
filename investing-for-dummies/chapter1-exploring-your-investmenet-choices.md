## Ownership investments 

Investments where you own an interest in some company or other asset (such as stocks, real estate or a small business)
that has the ability to generate revenue and profits


*Note* According to the author, ownership investments are the key to build wealth. If you dump all your money in bank
accounts that pay little if any interest, you're more likely to fall short of your retirement goals.


### Stock market

Stocks, which are shares of ownership in a company, are an example of an ownership investment. You usually buy shares 
accros a brokerage firm.
Instead of directly investing in stocks, you can invest in stocks via a stock mutual fund (or an exchange-traded fund),
where a fund manager decides which individual stocks to include in the fund


### Owning real estate

Is like running a small business: You need to satisfy customers (tenants), manage your costs, keep an eye on the competition
and so on.

*Real estate equity*

The value that remains when any liability (debts/loans) is subtracted from the fair market value of the real estate asset. 
In other terms, real estate equity refers to the portion of a property's value that an owner truly owns, free and clear 
of any debts or liabilities

_Equity=Market Value of Property−Outstanding Loan Balance_

For example, if a home is valued at €300,000 and the remaining mortgage is €200,000, the owner's equity is €100,000.


*TIP* Ultimately, to make your money grow much faster than inflation and taxes, you must take some risks. Any investment
that has real growth potential also has shrinkage potential!


### Running a small business

Full time investment :)


## Generating Income from lending investments

Other type of investment: Lending your money. Example: By keeping money in the bank

Bonds is a type of lending investment: When you purchase a bond that's been issued by the government or a company, you
agree to lend your money for a predetermined period of time and receive a particular rate of interest. 
A bond may pay you 4% of interest over the next 10 years, for example.

*Important Note:* An investor's return from lending investments is typicall *limited* to the original investment + interest payments.
If you lend your money to Argentina through one of its bonds that matures in, say, 8 year, and Argentina starts to be the 
lighthouse of the free world and triples it's size, you won't share in its growth. Argentina's stockholders and ownership 
investors reap the rewards of the country's success, but as a bondholder, you don't: You simply get interest and the face value
of the bond back at maturity

Although lending investments appear safer because you know in advance what return you'll receive, they aren't that safe. The
long-term risk of these seemingly safe money investments is that you rmoney will grow too slowly to enable you to accomplish 
your personal financial goals. In the worst cases, the company or other institution to which you lend money can enter in default.


### The problem with interest gains+taxes and inflation

If the interest rate is too low, and inflation or taxes to high, then you might be losing money even if you're investing it!

Example 1: The bank gives you 1.5% annual interest rate. Taxes on your interest (unless you invest in municipal bonds that are federal
and state tax-free or in a retirement account, in which case you pay taxes later when you withdraw the money) are 1/3, => Now you have 1% gain.
To the above, you need to discount inflation (goods usually raise their price during time)! In USA, inflation is 2% => You're 1% low!
What does it mean? That you have lost 1% of your investment and your real purchasing power has decreased.

From 1K euros:
- If you deposit that amount of money in an interesting-bearing account that gives 3.5% TAE (tasa anual equivalente)
- Inflation in Spain is of 2,4% (annual) (today, December 12th 2024)
- You need to pay 19% of taxes from the interests you gain

1.010,335 = 1000 + ((1000*0,035) - (1000*0,035)*0,019) - (1000 * 0,024)

So that means that in a year, from 1000 euros your net income is 10,335 euros


## Cash equivalents

Any investment that you can quickly convert to cash without cost to you. 

Example: 
Money market mutual funds 
 |-> generally invest in safe things, such as short-term bank certificates of deposit, 
	 U.S. government-issued Treasury bills, and commercial paper (short-term bonds) that the most creditworthy
	 corporations issue
 |-> Historically have produced higher yields than bank saving accounts
