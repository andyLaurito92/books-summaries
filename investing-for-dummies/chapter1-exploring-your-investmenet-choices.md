## Ownership investments 

Investments where you own an interest in some company or other asset (such as stocks, real estate or a small business)
that has the ability to generate revenue and profits


*Note* According to the author, ownership investments are the key to build wealth. If you dump all your money in bank
accounts that pay little if any interest, you're more likely to fall short of your retirement goals.


### Stock market

Stocks, which are shares of ownership in a company, are an example of an ownership investment. You usually buy shares 
accros a brokerage firm.
Instead of directly investing in stocks, you can invest in stocks via a stock mutual fund (or an exchange-traded fund),
where a fund manager decides which individual stocks to include in the fund


### Owning real estate

Is like running a small business: You need to satisfy customers (tenants), manage your costs, keep an eye on the competition
and so on.

*Real estate equity*

The value that remains when any liability (debts/loans) is subtracted from the fair market value of the real estate asset. 
In other terms, real estate equity refers to the portion of a property's value that an owner truly owns, free and clear 
of any debts or liabilities

_Equity=Market Value of Property−Outstanding Loan Balance_

For example, if a home is valued at €300,000 and the remaining mortgage is €200,000, the owner's equity is €100,000.
