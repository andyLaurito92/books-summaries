# Weighing Risks and Returns

- Risk is in the eye of the beholder. People base their perception of risk 
on their experience and what they've been exposed to. They fret about simple
matters, overlooking larger ones. Good example of this: Fret about stock options
but not about inflation or taxes


## Evaluating risks

- With increased knowledge, you may be able to reduce or conquer some of your fears 
and make more sensible decisions about reducing risks

Ex: Dying in an airplane accident is 110% less likely to happen than dying in a car accident 
according to statistics

*Note:*  If you attempt to avoid all the risks involved in investing, you likely won't succeed,
and you likely won't be happy with your investment results and lifestyle. In the investment world,
some people don't go near stocks or any investment that they perceive to be volatile. As a result,
such investors often end up with lousy long-term returns and expose themselves to some high risks
that they overlooked, such as the risk of having inflation and taxes


*Moral* You can't live without taking risks ;)
