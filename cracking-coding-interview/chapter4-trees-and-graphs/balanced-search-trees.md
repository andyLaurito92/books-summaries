# Balanced Search Trees

When presenting BST, the big issue with them is: The complexity of the operations depend entirely
on the data inserted into the data structure. Assuming randomness of the input, usually we will
have log N complexity, however is not always this case. 

In this section we cover balanced search trees and some of its implementations: 2-3 search trees,
red black BSTs and B-trees
