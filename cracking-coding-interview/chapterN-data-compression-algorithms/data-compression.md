## Compression Idea

To reduce the size of a file

*What for?*

2 main ideas:

- To save *space* when storing it
- To save *time* when transmitting it

*Note* Most of the files have a lot of redundancy!


*Idea* Even though it's true that its seems a bit odd being studying this when we have so large
storage capacity + compute capacity, what we really want to use that more storage and capacity for
is to update *data that has quality*, meaning, I don't want to waste more memory and internet 
throughput in *bad data quality*!
